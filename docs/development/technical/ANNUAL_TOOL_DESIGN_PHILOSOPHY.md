# Annual Monitoring Tools: Design Philosophy and Integration with BMAP

## Summary of Approach

Your goal is to develop a set of analysis tools specifically tailored for the annual monitoring/report workflow—tools that natively support the calculations, comparisons, and outputs you need, without requiring manual data manipulation or “creative” workarounds like you had to do with the original BMAP tools and Excel.

### Key Points

- The new tools should automate and streamline the annual analysis process, handling all the data prep, calculations, and reporting logic directly.
- They should be designed around your actual workflow and reporting needs, not just generic BMAP functionality.
- The original BMAP tools (as-is) will still be available in the “General Purpose Analyses” menu for ad hoc or legacy use, but the annual workflow will use improved, purpose-built versions.

## Next Steps

- Map out which BMAP tool features need to be adapted or extended for the annual workflow.
- Design the new tool interfaces and logic to match your reporting requirements, minimizing manual intervention.
- Ensure the CLI clearly separates “Annual Monitoring” tools (workflow-optimized) from “General Purpose” BMAP tools (vanilla/legacy).

## Guidance

If you have specific pain points or “creative” steps you want to eliminate, document them so they can be addressed directly in the tool design. The goal is to make the annual workflow as seamless and robust as possible, leveraging the best of BMAP but tailored for your real-world needs.
