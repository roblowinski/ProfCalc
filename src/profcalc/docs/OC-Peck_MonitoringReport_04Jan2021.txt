1. Introduction
1.1. Project Description
The City of Ocean City is located in Cape May County along the Atlantic Ocean Coast of New Jersey (Figure 1). Also known as Peck Beach, the barrier island extends from Great Egg Harbor Inlet on its northern boundary approximately 8 miles to Corson’s Inlet on its southern border. The project area doesn’t span the entire length of the barrier island, but ends approximately 4.5 miles from Great Egg Harbor Inlet at 34th St. A long-term erosion problem has been well-documented along the northern portion of Ocean City extending from 5th Street to 12th Street.
A shoreline protection project for Ocean City, NJ was initiated by the Philadelphia District in 1992. This beach nourishment project, entitled Great Egg Harbor Inlet and Peck Beach, NJ, is also supported by the non-Federal sponsors of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the City of Ocean City.
The project consists of an initial beachfill which occurred in 1992 with subsequent periodic nourishment on a 3-year cycle, and a beach profile and shoreline monitoring program for the project area. The authorized beach design template includes a minimum berm width of 100 feet at an elevation of +6.75 feet North Atlantic Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). The 100-foot berm is defined from either the seaward edge of boardwalk, bulkhead or a baseline where no boardwalk or bulkhead is present. The material for the initial construction and the subsequent periodic nourishments every three years is taken from the ebb shoal area located approximately 5,000 feet offshore of Great Egg Harbor Inlet. This periodic dredging of the channel and ebb shoal area also helps to alleviate navigation difficulties in the inlet. Additionally, initial project construction required the extension of 38 storm drain-pipes.
The initial fill operation was conducted in two phases; first 2.6 million cubic yards of sand were placed in the vicinity of Seaview Rd. to 15th St. and then approximately 2.7 million cubic yards of sand were placed from 15th St. to the project limit at 34th St, with a taper extending to 36th Street. Additionally, 846,000 cubic yards of sand were placed to repair erosion from storms occurring during initial construction. 











Figure 1. Location Map 
1.2. Project Status
The scheduled 8th periodic nourishment cycle took place between June 2020 and September 2020. Quantity placed was 1.6 MCY and was placed from Great Egg Harbor Inlet to 12th Street. In November to December 2017, through the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE) Act, PL 84-99, a total of 1.3 MCY was placed from Great Egg Harbor Inlet to 12th St. The FCCE program authorizes the Corps of Engineers to repair previously constructed projects after a large storm event and return the project area to pre-storm conditions. To date, eight periodic nourishments, 2 Emergency FCCE Beachfills, and 1 State/Local Beachfill have been conducted since initial construction with a total of almost 20 million cubic yards of sand placed. The history of the periodic beachfill nourishments for the project is shown in Figure 2 and Table 1. 
In 2009 the authorized Great Egg Harbor Inlet borrow area was expanded from 580 acres to 1,785 acres. Starting with the 6th nourishment cycle, a portion of the expanded borrow area was used in the vicinity of the natural channel within the inlet in order to help alleviate shoaling and improve navigation within the channel. The reason the borrow area was expanded in 2009 had to do with integrating the borrow location with the inlet’s natural hydrodynamics and geomorphology. By doing this expansion, impacts were minimized to the adjacent shorelines and the inlet system; The expansion also resulted in leaving the majority of the ebb shoal structure intact which provided increased protection and continued sediment supply for the northern end of Ocean City. This sediment should naturally move onshore and nourish the shoreline over time;  And, as an added benefit, improving navigation in the seaward region of the inlet channel.

1.3. Purpose of Report
The primary purpose of this inspection report is to document the current conditions of the Federal beach nourishment project located in Ocean City, NJ. The report will summarize the conditions and activities at the Federal project from July 2017 to September 2020. Refer to previous inspection reports for conditions of the Federal project prior to July 2017. South of the Great Egg Harbor and Peck Beach, the NJ project starting at 36th St. in Ocean City and proceeding south to Corson’s Inlet, is the Great Egg to Townsends Federal Beachfill Project. The Great Egg to Townsends Project had initial construction in 2016 and its first periodic nourishment was completed in September 2020. Previous inspection reports for this project included the analysis of the downdrift beach profiles that are within the limits of the Great Egg to Townsends Project. Analysis of the Great Egg to Townsends Federal Project including the beach profiles from 36th St. to Corson’s Inlet can be found in the latest inspection report for that project. 
 In addition, this report also provides information useful for project management and design purposes and can proactively be utilized for project maintenance or by the Federal Government in the event of an approaching storm to more efficiently execute the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE) mission. 
This report will identify project conditions relative to the design template defined in the decision document based upon the most recent annual monitoring survey collected in August 2020. It should be noted that the August 2020 survey took place during the latest nourishment project. When the survey data was collected, about 84% (1.36 MCY) had already been placed between Sta. 16+00 to 112+61 (Pinnacle Rd. to 12th St.). The remaining 254,000 cy of material was placed subsequently between Sta. 0+00 to 16+00 (Seaview Ave. to Pinnacle Rd). Therefore, the analyses summarized in this report of comparing the August 2020 survey against the design template will show a deficit of material north of Sta. 16+00 and surplus of material south of Sta. 16+00. Considering that the most recent survey coincided with the recent  nourishment, the project condition relative to the design template should not be used to predict quantities needs for the next nourishment cycle that is scheduled to occur in 2023. The next inspection report will be a better indicator of potential quantity needs in 2023 since a sufficient amount of time will have passed by then to allow the recent project condition to reach an equilibrium state.
In addition to the design template comparison, this report also tracks shoreline position and annual volumetric change from July 2017 to July 2020 by using the annual collected beach profile monitoring surveys in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Summaries of additional data collection efforts and analyses pertinent to assessing condition of the project are included. Recommendations are presented based on the project condition assessment. The bathymetric changes within Great Egg Harbor Inlet which includes the authorized borrow area for the project is also documented in this report from 2017 to 2020. 


















2. Coastal Monitoring Data Collection
2.1. Coastal Monitoring Program Description
The present coastal monitoring program for the Great Egg Harbor Inlet and Peck Beach, NJ Federal project includes beach profile surveys, pre- and post-storm ATV shoreline surveys, bathymetric borrow area surveys, and aerial photography. In addition, several surveys were collected associated with the FCCE renourishment beachfill in the Fall of 2017 and the recent 8th nourishment that concluded in September 2020. Table 2 summarizes the coastal monitoring data collected from 2017 to 2020.

Beach Profile Data Collection
The beach profile network established for the project starts on the inlet frontage at Great Egg Harbor Inlet and ends at 36th St in Ocean City. The network consists of 35 beach profiles within the project area of Seaview Rd. groin to the buffer/transition area at 36th St, spaced between 200 to 1,000 feet apart. The network was established for design purposes and to serve as the monitoring network in order to evaluate beachfill performance during the 50-year project span. Table A-1 in Appendix A summarizes the network and Figures B-1 to B-5 in Appendix B show the locations of the 40 profile lines. Beach profile surveys were collected for multiple purposes during the July 2017 to September 2020 time period that included routine annual examinations and pre- and post-placement surveys for the two beachfills that occurred during the time period. The summary of what profile lines were collected for each given survey is shown in Appendix C on Table C-1. Plots of the beach profiles used in the volumetric analysis and project monitoring for this inspection report are included in Figures D-1 to D-35 in Appendix D. Each profile plot shows the four annual surveys from 2017 to 2020 along with the design template. Data for all beach profile surveys are available upon request from the Philadelphia District.
2.3. Shoreline Data Collection
Shoreline positions at the +4.0 ft. NAVD88 elevation were extracted from the four annual examinations from July 2017 to August 2020. Shoreline locations extracted from these surveys were used to track the conditions of the beaches annually and prior to and after beachfill placement. 
2.4. Borrow Areas Bathymetry
Since the Great Egg Harbor and Peck Beach, NJ beach fill project was initiated in 1992, hydrographic surveys of the Great Egg Harbor Inlet complex have routinely been collected. Within the timeframe of this report, yearly hydrographic surveys were conducted in the inlet which included the Federal borrow area (original and expanded) and the surrounding channel and ebb shoal complex. Line spacing for all surveys was 400 feet in the alongshore direction (SW to NE) and 500 feet in the offshore direction (SE to NW). Figure 3 shows the coverage for the July 2017 survey which is typical of the coverage captured in the annual examinations. Data for all hydrographic surveys is available upon request from the Philadelphia District.
2.5. Other Data Collection Efforts
Georeferenced aerial photography from 2017 is available online from the State of New Jersey at https://njgin.nj.gov/njgin/edata/imagery/index.html#!/. High-resolution LiDAR of the project area from various sources for 2017 and 2018 can be obtained from https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/. Also, tide data from the NOS gages at Atlantic City, NJ and Cape May, NJ were referenced as needed to assess water level conditions (tide and surge) at the project.

3. Data Analysis
3.1. Beach Profiles
Design Template. The full design template was previously developed for each profile by translating the September 2011 profile shape below MHW and aligning with the adjusted design template above MHW. This method of defining the template profile shape below MHW is consistent with equilibrium profile concepts discussed in EM-1110-2-1100 (2006). In applying the profile shape below MHW, a smoothing algorithm was applied to smooth the profile shape as needed for presentation purposes.
The full design template extends from the design baseline to the depth of closure defined at the seaward limit of nearshore profile change. The applied depth of closure ranged from -11 ft. NAVD88 in the northern part of the barrier island near Great Egg Harbor Inlet to -22 ft. NAVD88 at the southern end of the project area. Changes in offshore features beyond the defined depth of closure were not considered in the analysis as they are assumed to be decoupled from nearshore profile change at the timescale of interest (CHETN II-40, 1998).
Volumetric Calculations. All volumetric calculations were performed by calculating cross-sectional areas for each profile as shown in Figures 4-7 for each time period above MHW and above closure depth and in Tables E-1 and E-2 in Appendix E. Changes in volumes from year to year between adjacent beach profiles were calculated using the cross-sectional area changes and the average-end-area method. The average-end-area method was applied by averaging adjacent profile areas and multiplying by the orthogonal distance between profile azimuths. Where adjacent profile azimuths differed, the difference was accounted for by adding (if azimuths diverged) or subtracting (if azimuths converged) a representative wedge volume to the orthogonal volume. The representative wedge volume was determined by multiplying each end area by an arc length, s and then averaging. The arc length for each end area was calculated by s=r?, where r is the radial distance from the profile origin to the centroid of the end area, and ? is the difference angle between the end profile azimuths.

Figure 7. Cross-Sectional Area Changes for July 2017 to August 2020
Project Volume Change. Annual incremental project volumetric changes from 2017 to 2020 and cumulative volumetric were calculated to assess changes within the project footprint as shown on Tables E-3 to E-6 in Appendix E and Figure E-1. Total volume change was calculated using the entire active profile (design baseline to profile depth of closure), and subaerial volume was calculated using data above the MHW contour. Figures E-2 to E-8 in Appendix E show visually in plan view the profile line to profile line volumetric changes for the entire 2017 to 2020 analysis period. It is recommended that additional analyses be conducted in future inspection reports to determine a volume loss rate and to update the background erosion rates, free from influences of beachfills being placed so that advance nourishment quantities can be projected for future beach nourishments. 
Project Condition vs. Design Template. The August 2020 surveyed condition was compared to the design template to determine deficit quantities below template and excess quantities above template (Appendix F, Tables F-1 and F-2). As previously stated, the August 2020 survey took place during the latest nourishment project. Therefore, the analyses summarized in this report of comparing the August 2020 survey against the design template shows a deficit of material in areas where beachfill had not occurred prior to August (Sta 0+00 to Sta. 16+00) and a large surplus of material in the recently filled areas just prior to the August 2020 survey. Considering that the most recent survey coincided with the recent nourishment, the project condition relative to the design template should not be used to predict advance nourishment needs for the next nourishment cycle that is scheduled to occur in 2023. The updated project condition versus design template analysis that will be done in the next inspection report will be a better indicator of potential nourishment needs in 2023 since a sufficient amount of time will have passed by then to allow the recent project condition to reach an equilibrium state.


3.2. Shorelines
Shoreline Position vs. Design Template. Shoreline positions were extracted from each profile at the +4 ft. NAVD88 elevation, which lies approximately mid-elevation between MHW and the berm crest. Plots of shoreline positions for each of the surveys (2017 through to 2020) and the design template are shown in Appendix G in Figures G-1 to G-6. Tables of shoreline positions relative to the project baseline and the design template at each profile line location are shown on Table H-1 and H-2 in Appendix H. Lastly, the existing condition shoreline (August 2020) was compared to the design template shoreline at each beach profile to determine the minimum, maximum, and average offsets at the +4.0 ft. NAVD 88 elevation. Results are presented in both Section I-3 of the Project Performance Summary on page ii of this report and in Appendix H in Table H-3. Negative distances indicate the existing shoreline has eroded to a point landward of the design shoreline, while positive values indicate the existing shoreline (August 2020) is seaward of the design shoreline.
Projected Erosion and Advance Nourishment. This analysis is typically completed for an annual inspection report but wasn’t completed for this report due to the timing of the report coinciding with the 8th nourishment cycle that was completed in September 2020. It would be premature to update the estimate of recent project erosion given the fact that beachfill was just placed for the 8th nourishment. Estimated advance nourishment quantities needed for the 9th nourishment cycle, based upon updated erosion rates calculated from the data in this report would likely be higher than needed based upon the rapid adjustment of the beach to achieve an equilibrium state. As stated in previous Great Egg Harbor and Peck Beach, NJ inspection reports, the background erosion rates have increased since the last time annual erosion rates that were used for advance nourishment calculations were determined using the 2001 to 2004 time period. The 2001 to 2004 time period was used because it was void of any beachfill projects that could potentially result in over-predicting annual erosion rates. The average annual erosion rates will be updated in the next inspection report and will utilize multiple time periods free of any beachfill activity and be adjusted as necessary to reflect recent trends.
3.3. Borrow Areas
Both inlet and borrow area hydrographic surveys were collected to monitor before and after dredging activities from the 2017 and 2020 beachfills and infilling of the borrow area. Annual hydrographic surveys of Great Egg Harbor Inlet were conducted in the Summers between 2017 and 2020 which included both the original and expanded Federal borrow areas and the entire inlet channel and ebb shoal complex. The amount of material above the authorized dredging depth that could be available for the next renourishment within the original borrow area is presented in Section I-6 of the Project Performance Summary on page iii and in Section 4.1 of this report. Recent inlet and borrow area surveys are plotted in Figures I-1 to I-8 in Appendix I along with difference plots showing areas of shoaling and scouring between successive surveys.




4. Project Condition Evaluation
4.1. Summary of Project Condition
The three-year volumetric change between July 2017 and August 2020 as shown on Figures E-2 to E-8 in Appendix E include volume added to the project area from the two beachfills that occurred in the same time window. So, what is shown should not be considered as an indicator of natural background erosion rates for the areas that received fill. However, the figures can be looked as an indicator of what is going on south of the beachfill placement area (12th St.). The figures do indicate that there were some minor losses to the offshore above MHW south of the fill area from 12th St to 21st St. and deposition of material (greater than 10,000 cy) from 21st St to the end of the project area. Looking at this same area from the previous inspection report which covered the 2013 to 2017 time period, it can seen that the above MHW loss of material to the offshore reach length has expanded. From 2013 to 2017, the above MHW loss of material to the offshore ended at 15th St. (OC027A). If this loss of material above MHW trend continues, future renourishments may have to expand south of 12th St. Typically, the eight renourishments completed to date have terminated around 11th to 13th St. 
As of the August 2020 beach profile survey, the project is below template at the stations (0+00 to 16+00) that will be filled during the last month of the nourishment project. Recently fill areas (Sta. 16+00 to 112+61) obviously show beach conditions well above the design template due to the recent beachfill. It is expected that as the beaches adjust to an equilibrium condition this surplus will not be as pronounced in the coming months through the winter season. In the next inspection report, surveys collected in the Summer of 2021 will be examined to ascertain beach conditions relative to the design template at that time. The rapid adjustment that always takes place shortly after a beachfill should be completed by then as the beaches return to a more stable equilibrium condition.
The past trend of a very stable to accreting beach condition south of Sta. 128+00 (15th St.) to the end of the Federal Project is continuing. Traditionally, no nourishment is needed in this area due to being downdrift of the more dynamic beach conditions in the northern part of the project area. Generally speaking, the trend of 25% of the entire project length needing 75% of the nourishment volume every 3-years is continuing. The design template’s extracted +4.0 ft. NAVD88 location versus the extracted +4.0 ft. NAVD88 from the August 2020 survey shows that 88% of the entire project length is seaward of the design template. Upon examination of the post-placement surveys collected by the beachfill Contractor in September 2020, the 12% that was not seaward in August (Sta 0+00 to 16+00), was seaward at the conclusion of the beachfill project in September 2020. 
An analysis of the material gained above MHW between the July 2017 to August 2018 time period (2017 FCCE beachfill) versus the material “lost” above MHW one year after the beachfill  (August 2018 to August 2019) was completed. Since the time periods were similar 385 versus 387 days between surveys a direct one versus one comparison is reasonable to do. It should be noted that in the time after a large beachfill like what was done in 2017, material placed above MHW is not considered to be “eroded away” and “lost” but as translated to the offshore where it can’t be seen but is still providing a benefit in reducing the risk to the community of coastal storm damage as designed. The difference of material “gained” during versus material “lost” above MHW after the 2017 beachfill can provide some insight as to the background erosion characteristics of the area such as specific location(s) and magnitude of stable areas, erosional “hot spot” areas, or accreting areas. Also, knowing this along with conducting other supplemental analyses that will be done in subsequent inspection reports can assist in the calculations of advance nourishment needs for future beachfills. Table 3 summarizes the above MHW volumetric changes that occurred during and after the 2017 beachfill at each profile line.

As Table 3 shows, the above MHW volumetric losses to the offshore were highest between Moorlyn Terrace and 12th St (OC021 to OC024). This is consistent with past experiences for the location of the “hot spot” area in Ocean City being near the Music Pier at 9th St. Further north towards Great Egg Harbor Inlet away from the Music Pier shows a gradual reduction in the loss rates to the offshore after the 2017 nourishment. Approximately, it took 4,600 feet to Stenton Place (OC013) for the losses to the offshore to reduce to below 25%. South of the Music Pier at 9th St, Table 3 also shows a much faster transition to the lower loss rates of 25% or less to the offshore. It took 8,000 feet (almost twice the distance), down to 25th St (OC039) for losses to the offshore to get below 25%. This type of analysis will be done in the next inspection report using data after the 2020 nourishment to see if the most recent nourishment behaved in a similar manner. Knowing this kind of information will be another helpful tool when it comes time to calculate advance nourishment needs in the future.
One of the purposes of doing a yearly inspection report is to see if reworking material from areas of excess and moving it to areas in deficit can be accomplished thus reducing the amount of material needed to be dredged from the borrow area. However, this reworking of material has typically not been done for Ocean City in the past because the borrow area has always had ample available material within the traditional southwest portion of the borrow area and in the navigation channel.
This practice of not reworking excess material may need to be revisited in the future if more borrowing demands are placed upon the inlet every three years. Needing 1.6 MCY every 3 years versus the typical 1.0 to 1.2 MCY may require dredging within the permitted borrow area in places not typically dredged. It has already been observed to some extent, as the borrow areas used for each nourishment project have crept to the northwest because of the need to “find” more available material as Figure 8 shows. If the need to dredge additional material increases every three years that could increase the risk to coastal storms for the northern part of Ocean City near the inlet. That’s because the northern part of Ocean City is protected somewhat due to being in the shadow of the inlet’s shallower waters from the shoal complex.



Figure 8. History of Great Egg Harbor Inlet Borrow Area Configurations
An infilling analysis of the permitted Great Egg Harbor Inlet borrow area and the original smaller borrow area used for the first five nourishments within the larger permitted borrow area was conducted utilizing the annual hydrographic surveys collected in the Summers of 2017 to 2020. As beachfill quantities have increased by approximately 300,000 cy over the last three renouirshments (Table 1), it is important to monitor the borrow area on a yearly basis to make sure it is infilling at a rate equal to or greater than the demands placed upon it from dredging it every three years and to make sure natural inlet processes are not interrupted. As previously discussed, if infilling slows down while demands remain the same or increase, then future dredging may have to be conducted within the borrow area at locations not traditionally dredged in the past. This is not desirable because the natural morphological processes and patterns within the inlet could be adversely affected. The updated infilling analysis showing pre 2017 rates along with the recent post 2017 rates are shown in Table 4 for the large permitted borrow and in Table 5 for the smaller original borrow area used for the first five nourishments. Figure 9 graphically shows available material for both areas from August 2013 to August 2020.

Figure 9. Available Material History in Great Egg Harbor Borrow Area From 2013 to 2020
As Table 4 shows, the permitted borrow area infilled a total quantity of 897,000 cy from August 2013 to December 2020 despite there being three beachfills that used the Great Egg Harbor inlet borrow area for material during that time. The source of the large quantity that infilled the permitted borrow area between August 2013 and September 2015 was from beach erosion in the northern part of Ocean City due to Super Storm Sandy that occurred at the end of October 2012 and sediment transport to the south into the inlet from Absecon Island.
4.2. Recommendations
The northern area of the project continues to erode below template between renourishments, but the large majority of the project consistently exceeds the design template. The general trend of 25% of the project length requiring 75% of the nourishment is continuing.
Above MHW, the project continues to maintain surplus of material starting at Gardens Rd (Sta. 34+00) in excess of the design template by over 1.8 MCY. While some of this excess sand helps to stabilize the shoreline immediately adjacent to the eroding areas to the north (thereby limiting further losses) much of the sand is located in stable or accreting areas and could potentially be removed by bypassing or backpassing operations to provide supplemental fill to the northern eroding area. This “reservoir” of surplus sand could be used if the demands placed upon the borrow area continue to increase every three years. Using at least some of this surplus sand would be a better option than to over-dredge the borrow area to such an extent where new areas within the borrow area would be needed. Dredging these “new” subareas within the borrow area could increase the risks to the northern part of Ocean City because the shoals within the inlet complex reduce the wave energy impacting the beaches. Bypassing or backpassing operations from the southern portion to the northern portion of the project area has not been typically considered for Ocean City because of the expectations of the municipality and NJDEP to fill the project area with 1.0 MCY to 1.4 MCY of sand every 3 years (as done eight times over the last 24 years). Since Great Egg Harbor Inlet regularly infills with good quality sand typically from the beaches of Ocean City itself; the quantity of available sand for a 1.0 MCY to 1.4 MCY beachfill has not been an issue every 3 years.
To better track fill sand placed during renourishment, precondition and post construction (as built) profile surveys should continue to be collected on the project monitoring lines (separate from construction payment surveys). Construction after-dredge payment surveys cannot be use effectively in the monitoring analysis because they are collected over a shifting time window and do not align spatially with the monitoring profile lines. Separate as-built monitoring surveys will enable more accurate tracking of sand placed during construction.
Continuation of assessing the project’s conditions annually, which is one of the primary objectives for the beachfill monitoring program, is a necessity in order to ensure that project functionality is maintained throughout the 50-year design lifetime. Project condition monitoring for Ocean City should at a minimum consist of Summer to Fall surveys of the profile lines within the Federal project area and the downdrift area to Corson’s Inlet (part of the Great Egg to Townsends Inlet Federal Project) along with the annual Summer/Fall bathymetric surveys of Great Egg Harbor Inlet.
Bathymetric surveys within Great Egg Harbor Inlet have been conducted annually for the past seventeen years. The dynamic nature of the inlet significantly impacts the northern portion of Ocean City and the beachfill placed there. In order to better understand the sediment pathways within the inlet, and the potential impacts of dredging within the borrow area has on the northern beaches of Ocean City, the past recommendation of developing an updated hydrodynamic model and sediment budget is still recommended for Great Egg Harbor Inlet. Since there is a substantial amount of material available in the expanded permitted borrow area; it is crucial to optimize how the inlet should be dredged in the future in order to minimize adverse impacts and promote beneficial impacts to the north end of the Federal project. Conducting these types of studies would also provide insight to the fact that nourishment quantities have increased over the past three renourishment cycles
It is also recommended that a detailed analysis with modeling be conducted that examines the long-term annual erosion rates and trends for the northern portion of the project area. A detailed analysis and modeling effort could determine if erosion rates increase post beachfill, as the construction berm’s seaward edge is “pushed” further out offshore. Experience has shown that it is very difficult to maintain a berm for three years that doesn’t erode to the point where the design template gets compromised. Maybe overfilling the “hot spot” area would help in keeping an adequate buffer of sand seaward of the design berm for a full three years, or maybe it wouldn’t, because erosion would take all that excess sand and transport it to the north into the inlet in short order. A detailed analysis coupled with the inlet modeling discussed previously would provide better insights into the complex nature of the area.
