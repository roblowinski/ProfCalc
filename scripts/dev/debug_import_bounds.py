# =============================================================================
# Bounds Import Debug Script
# =============================================================================
#
# FILE: scripts/dev/debug_import_bounds.py
#
# PURPOSE:
# This debug script tests the importability of the bounds module and related
# functionality. It provides a simple verification that bounds-related imports
# are working correctly during development and troubleshooting.
#
# WHAT IT'S FOR:
# - Testing bounds module import functionality
# - Quick verification of bounds-related dependencies
# - Debugging import issues with bounds components
# - Development-time validation of bounds imports
#
# WORKFLOW POSITION:
# This script is used during development and debugging to quickly verify that
# bounds-related modules can be imported without errors. It's a simple diagnostic
# tool for troubleshooting import issues.
#
# LIMITATIONS:
# - Very basic import test only
# - No functional testing of bounds operations
# - Limited diagnostic information
# - Single-purpose debug script
#
# ASSUMPTIONS:
# - Bounds module exists and is importable
# - Python environment is properly configured
# - No complex import dependencies
#
# =============================================================================

print('imported bounds OK')
