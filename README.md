# Profile Analysis Tools

## Overview
The Profile Analysis Tools package is a Python-based framework designed for coastal engineers to analyze beach profile data. It replicates the functionality of the USACE Beach Morphology Analysis Package (BMAP) and extends it with modern features for integration, testing, and customization.

This package includes tools for beach profile analysis, beachfill construction monitoring, and long-term coastal monitoring. It is designed to be modular and extendable to support a wide range of coastal engineering tasks.

## Features
- **BMAP-equivalent tools**: Tools for generating equilibrium profiles, profile comparisons, volume calculations, and more.
- **Profile comparison and analysis**: Tools for computing elevation differences, volume changes, and contour shifts.
- **Monitoring and construction tools**: Utilities for analyzing beach profile changes over time and during beachfill construction projects.
- **Data integration**: Compatible with CSV, Excel, and other formats for easy import of profile data.
- **Scalable architecture**: Easily extendable to include new tools or workflows as needed.
